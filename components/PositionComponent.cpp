#include "PositionComponent.h"

// PositionComponent does not require any specific implementation beyond its definition
// as it primarily holds data. If any logic related to position manipulation
// is needed (e.g., movement, transformation), it would typically be handled
// by a PositionSystem or a similar game entity management system.
