#include "BuildingBlueprint.h"

// Since all methods are currently inline in the header or removed,
// this file can be empty or contain only necessary includes/static definitions.

// If we need to move implementation back here later, we can.
// For now, the header handles everything to resolve the compilation errors
// caused by out-of-sync .cpp file.
